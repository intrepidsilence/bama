# __APP_NAME__

A native macOS app in SwiftUI. It runs on this Mac only, with a local
SwiftData database and no server. Claude builds and checks it; the user
decides what it does.

## Layout

- `Sources/__APP_NAME__/` the app. `App.swift` has the window, menus, and the database location.
- `Sources/__APP_NAME__Kit/` rules and data logic with no SwiftUI. Tests in `Tests/__APP_NAME__KitTests/`.
- `Package.swift` a Swift package. There is no Xcode project.
- `build.sh` builds, signs, and installs `~/Applications/__APP_NAME__.app`.
- `Icon/AppIcon.icon` the app icon, an Icon Composer file (JSON plus SVG layers). `build.sh` compiles it with `tools/make_icon.sh`; `tools/icon_review.sh` renders every look into `.work/icon/review.png`.
- `docs/` the brief, the screen index, and the user stories, when they exist.
- `.work/` everything temporary: snapshots, test stores, renders. It is in `.gitignore`. Nothing goes to `/tmp`.

## Build and check

- Build and install: `./build.sh`. Add `--open` to restart the app with the new build. The build shows warnings; fix them.
- Unit tests: `swift test --scratch-path ~/Library/Developer/__APP_NAME__/test-build`.
- Self-test (the app's real functions on `.work/self.store`): `tools/selftest.sh`. Exit 0 when every check passes. Add a check for every story with logic in `SelfTest.swift`.
- After every UI change, take snapshots with sample data and look at them: `tools/snap.sh`.
  It writes `.work/shots/macos/<page>-light.png` and `-dark.png` for every sidebar page, and `settings-<tab>-light.png` and `-dark.png` for every Settings tab, then quits. `APP_SNAPSHOT_PAGES=all,settings tools/snap.sh` limits the pages.
  For a panel, sheet, or popover, add a capture to `Snapshot.swift` like the Settings loop.
- Snapshots, seed data, and the self-test refuse to run unless `APP_STORE` is set to a test file outside the real data folder. The scripts use `.work/test.store` and `.work/self.store`.
- Never test against the real database in `~/Library/Application Support/__APP_NAME__/`.
- Then check the grid: `tools/grid-lint.sh` and `swift tools/check-layout.swift .work/shots/macos/*-layout.json`. Both print PASS.
- A change is done when the build has no errors, the grid checks pass, and Claude looked at the light and dark snapshots.
- Every script takes `--platform macos`, the only platform of this project, so commands match the multi-platform template.

## Outside the project

Build products live in `~/Library/Developer/__APP_NAME__/` and the app in
`~/Applications/__APP_NAME__.app`, so iCloud and Dropbox do not sync them.

- `tools/footprint.sh` lists every place the project keeps files outside this folder, with sizes.
- `tools/footprint.sh clean` removes them all, and `.work/`. It never removes the real data folder.
- Anything new a change creates outside the project gets a line in `tools/footprint.sh` in the same change.

## Design rules

- Use Apple's controls and system styles. Only the accent color is custom: `UI/Theme.swift` (`ThemeStore.defaultID`). People change it in Settings > Appearance; light and dark mode follow the Mac.
- Views use `.tint`, `Palette.accent`, `Palette.accentText` (accent-colored text), and `Palette.onAccent` (text on an accent fill). Never hard-code colors, radii, or durations in views.
- Compare accents: add `APP_ACCENT=<id>` to the snapshot command.
- Spacing comes from `Space` in `UI/Grid.swift`, on a 4 pt grid. Mark custom pages and cards with `.gridArea` and `.gridProbe`.
- Windows open calm: `.noInitialFocus()` on every window and sheet (no focus ring or selected text on open), `.fitsContent()` on sheets and Settings tabs (no scroll bar with nothing to scroll). System scroll bars. Both in `UI/WindowBehavior.swift`.
- Settings: one tab per topic in `SettingsView.swift`, one grouped Form per tab. Add a case to `SettingsTab` for a new tab.
- Window chrome (title bar, toolbar, sidebar, menus, sheets) stays system. Buttons use system styles, like `.borderedProminent`.
- Colors: `.primary`, `.secondary`, `.tint`, and system colors. Never fixed grays or white for text.
- Every action has a menu bar item and a keyboard shortcut.
- `Label` for icon and text pairs. SF Symbols for icons.
- `ContentUnavailableView` for empty states.
- Liquid Glass belongs to floating controls only, never to content.

## Skills

The bama plugin has a skill for each step. Claude calls them with the Skill
tool: `bama:mac-design` (design rules), `bama:design-system` (accent and
tokens), `bama:layout-grid`, `bama:ux-design`, `bama:swift-swiftui`,
`bama:os-integrations`, `bama:performance`, `bama:build-and-verify`,
`bama:test-app`, `bama:app-icon`, `bama:user-stories`, and
`bama:improve-loop`.

## Git

- Stage named paths (`git add <paths>`), never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Commit after each working change, with a message that says what the user can now do. Never push.
